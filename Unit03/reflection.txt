What is one new thing that you learned today?
 - I learned how you can use Thread.sleep() to control the wait time before code is executed

What is one thing that you wish you knew more about as we move forward?
 - I wish to learn more about when it is appropriate to make a class run single-threaded vs multi-threaded

What one question do you have about todayâ€™s class?
 - Even though .join() is the better option when using many threads, is there any cases where you would
 have to use while (thread.isAlive())
