This practicum has been divided into 4 parts. You will find the instructions 
for each part in the appropriately named package. Carefully read the 
instructions for each problem before attempting it.

The scoring for this exam will work a little differently than usual. Your 
grader will first compute your grade for each individual problem as a 
percentage using the standard grading rubric. You will then be awarded points
according to the following formula:

40 * highest +
30 * second highest +
20 * third highest +
10 * lowest

In other words, the higher your score on any individual question, the more 
points that question will be worth.

For example, let's say you get the following percentage grades for each 
question:

1: 95%
2: 100%
3: 50%
4: 80%

Your final grade on the exam would be:

(40 * 1.0) + (30 * 0.95) + (20 * 0.80) + (10 * 0.5) = 89.5
