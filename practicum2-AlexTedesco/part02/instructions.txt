========== Part 2 ============================================================

Take a moment to examine the Prime class that has been provided to you. Note 
that the NUMBERS array contains the first 1000 prime numbers.

Define a new Java class named PrimePrinter and use your preferred method to 
make it into a thread. Add a field for an index and an initializing 
constructor. When your thread is started, it should print the value at the 
specified index in NUMBERS. You should use sleep to try and make sure that the
numbers print in ascending order.

Define a main method with the appropriate signature. Use it to create and
start 50 of your threads. Use join to make sure that the main method waits 
until all of the threads have finished before printing a message. 

For full credit you MUST make sure that the threads are running concurrently 
(and not sequentially). Hint: DO NOT use join inside the same loop that you are
using to create and start your threads! 

Note that it is impossible to guarantee that the threads will print in the 
correct order using only sleeps.  Here is some example output:
