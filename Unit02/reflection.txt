What is one new thing that you learned today?
 - I learned how classes interact wit each other through the use of observers and there purpose 
 is to notify the class about any time an object is changed. For example if a card is flipped.

What is one thing that you wish you knew more about as we move forward?
 - I wish to learn more about using Vgrow and Hgrow to make boxes in a pane equal in size as opposed to
 using the setMaxSize function.

What one question do you have about todayâ€™s class?
 - Do MediaPlayers apply to all media formats? Can all of what was done with the music player
 be done the same with video files as well?
