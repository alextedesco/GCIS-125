What is one new thing that you learned today?
 - You can use .wait() and .notify() to change the current status of a thread

What is one thing that you wish you knew more about as we move forward?
 - If a deadlock is permanent and the only solution is stopping the program, does that imply
 that when it occurs in large scale projects everything can be lost?

What one question do you have about todayâ€™s class?
 - When doing synchronized you can pass in either an object key or this. When is it
 better to use one of the other.
