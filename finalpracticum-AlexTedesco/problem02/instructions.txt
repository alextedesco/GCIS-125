Note: This problem is meant to be solved using TCP/IP Networking.

Create a new Java class named "SumClient" in this package. Define a main method
with the appropriate signature. Your main method should do the following 
EXACTLY ONCE (do not loop):

* Prompt the user to enter an integer value.
* Open a TCP/IP connection to the local computer on port 54123.
* Send the integer value to the server.
* Read the response from the server (also an integer) and print it out. The 
  value should be the total sum of all integers sent to the server by any 
  clients that have connected.
* Do not forget to close any resources that you have opened.
* If an exception occurs, throw it and end the program.

The example output below shows running FOUR DIFFERENT clients:

enter an integer: 12345
current total sum is: 12345
Goodbye!

enter an integer: 23456
current total sum is: 35801
Goodbye!

enter an integer: 10010001
current total sum is: 10045802
Goodbye!

enter an integer: -1000005
current total sum is: 9045797
Goodbye!
