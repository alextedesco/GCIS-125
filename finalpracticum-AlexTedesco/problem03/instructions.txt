Note: This problem is meant to be solved using UDP Networking.

Create a new Java class named "UDPSumServer" in this package.

Define a main method with the appropriate signature. Your main method should 
do the following:

* Initialize an integer sum at 0.
* Listen for incoming UDP packets on port 54125.
* Repeat until the program is terminated:
  * When a packet is received, read the string value from inside of it and 
    convert it into an integer. Hint: use the Integer.parseInt(string) method.
  * Add the integer value to the sum.
  * Return the total sum (as a string) in a UDP packet addressed to the client. 
    Hint: you can get the client's address and port from the packet you 
    received from the client.
* You may ignore any warnings related to closing the server - your program 
  should run until it is terminated, e.g. using CTRL-C or closing the terminal
  window.
* If an exception occurs, throw it and end the program.

Example output below shows ONE server receiving connections from FOUR different
clients:

Waiting for client...
Client connected!
  received: 12345
  sum is now 12345
  sending: 12345
  client closed.

Waiting for client...
Client connected!
  received: 23456
  sum is now 35801
  sending: 35801
  client closed.

Waiting for client...
Client connected!
  received: 10010001
  sum is now 10045802
  sending: 10045802
  client closed.

Waiting for client...
Client connected!
  received: -1000005
  sum is now 9045797
  sending: 9045797
  client closed.

Waiting for client...
