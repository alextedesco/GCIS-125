Note: This problem is meant to be solved using UDP Networking.

Create a new Java class named "SumClient" in this package. Define a main method
with the appropriate signature. Your main method should do the following 
EXACTLY ONCE (do not  loop):

* Prompt the user to enter an integer value.
* Send a UDP packet containing the integer value (as a string) to the local 
  computer on port 54125.
* Receive a UDP packet from the server (as a string) and print it out. The 
  value should be the total sum of all integers sent to the server by any 
  clients that have connected.
* If an exception occurs, throw it and end the program.

The example output below shows running FOUR DIFFERENT clients:

enter an integer: 12345
current total sum is: 12345
Goodbye!

enter an integer: 23456
current total sum is: 35801
Goodbye!

enter an integer: 10010001
current total sum is: 10045802
Goodbye!

enter an integer: -1000005
current total sum is: 9045797
Goodbye!
